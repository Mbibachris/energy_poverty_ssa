## Overview

This repository contains the data-processing and modelling code for a study on multidimensional energy poverty across African countries, combining:

1. **Index construction** — a Multidimensional Energy Poverty Index (MEPI) built with the Alkire–Foster (2011) dual-cutoff methodology.
2. **Algorithmic driver identification** — Recursive Feature Elimination followed by nine machine learning models, interpreted with feature importance, SHAP values, Partial Dependence Plots and Individual Conditional Expectation curves.
3. **Econometric validation** — panel fixed-effects/random-effects estimation with a Hausman test.

The project began as a Sub-Saharan Africa study and has since been extended to cover a wider panel of African countries.

**Note on `03_driver_analysis/`:** Recursive Feature Elimination and the machine-learning models are implemented together with the interpretability analysis in a single notebook, `04_results/Modelling.ipynb`, rather than as a separate stage. The `03_driver_analysis/` folder is kept for structural clarity but its content lives in `04_results/`.

**Not included in this repository:** the manuscript draft and generated figures/results tables are kept local-only until the paper is published, to avoid pre-publication disclosure of results.

## Data

All data are sourced from the **World Bank World Development Indicators (WDI)** database, covering a multi-decade panel of African countries.

| Category | Variables | Role |
|---|---|---|
| MEPI construction | 13 indicators across 5 dimensions | Dependent variable components |
| Driver variables | 34 candidate variables across 6 theoretical traditions | Independent variables |

## Methodology

**MEPI construction:** built across five dimensions — electricity access, affordability & efficiency, reliability, clean cooking, and sustainability — each with equal weight, using the Alkire–Foster (2011) dual-cutoff method (indicator-level cutoff zⱼ = 1/3, poverty cutoff k = 1/3, MEPI = H × A).

**Driver identification:** 34 candidate driver variables spanning six theoretical traditions (economic & income, natural resource & fiscal, institutional & governance, demographic & spatial, environmental, structural energy mix) are narrowed via Recursive Feature Elimination (Random Forest estimator) to a smaller final set used in the machine learning and panel models.

**Machine learning models:** LASSO, Ridge, Elastic Net, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, Support Vector Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbours — tuned with 5-fold `GridSearchCV` on a temporally-ordered train/test split. Interpreted using feature importance, SHAP (TreeExplainer), Partial Dependence Plots, and Individual Conditional Expectation curves.

**Panel econometrics:** `stata/panel_analysis.do` estimates fixed-effects and random-effects models on the selected drivers, applies log/IHS transformations for skewed variables, and uses a Hausman (1978) test to choose between FE and RE.

## Replication

Run notebooks in order:
```
01_data_cleaning        → produces cleaned panel data
02_mepi_construction    → produces country-year MEPI scores
04_results              → RFE, ML models, lag analysis, interpretability
stata/panel_analysis.do → FE/RE estimation and Hausman test (run from within stata/)
```
